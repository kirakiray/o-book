The basic files are equivalent to the scaffold for starting the o-book. They are necessary to preview and package the project. They are indirectly related to your Markdown website, and the packaged files will not include these basic files. If you are not a developer or don't care about the details of the scaffold, you can skip this chapter and directly view the [project files](./project-docs.md).
