The basic files are equivalent to the scaffold for starting the `o-book` and are required as a foundation for previewing and packaging projects. They are indirectly related to your Markdown website, and the packaged files will not include these basic files. If you are not a developer or do not care about the details of the scaffold, you can skip this section and directly view the [project files](./project-docs.md).
