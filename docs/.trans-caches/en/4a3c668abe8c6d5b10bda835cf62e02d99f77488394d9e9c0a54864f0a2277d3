The base files are equivalent to the scaffolding for `o-book` startup. They serve as the foundation for previewing and packaging your project. They are indirectly related to your Markdown website, and the packaged files will not include these base files. If you are not a developer or do not care about the details of the scaffolding, you can skip this chapter and go directly to [Project Files](./project-docs.md).
