The basic files are equivalent to the scaffolding for starting `o-book` and are necessary for previewing and packaging the project. They are indirectly related to your Markdown website, and these basic files will not be included in the packaged files. If you are not a developer or do not care about the details of the scaffolding, you can skip this chapter and directly view the [project files](./project-docs.md).
