The basic files are equivalent to the scaffold for `o-book`, which is necessary to preview and build the project. They are indirectly related to your Markdown website, and the packaged files will not include these basic files. If you are not a developer or do not care about the details of the scaffold, you can skip this chapter and go directly to [project files](./project-docs.md).
