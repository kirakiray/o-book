Before using o-book, you need to have a good understanding of the basic syntax of [Markdown](https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown). Additionally, you will need a text editor. We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is not only free, but also has a wide range of extensions available for you to choose from, making your document editing work more efficient.
