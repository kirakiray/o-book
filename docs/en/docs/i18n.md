# Multilanguage support

You can add documentation in other languages by modifying the `book-tool` component inside the `_preview.html` file and adding a `source` tag. Please note that the documentation in other languages must correspond one-to-one with the original content.

```html
<book-tool sw="./sw.js">
    <!-- Reference your project configuration file -->
    <source src="./en/config.json" lang="en" />
    <source src="./cn/config.json" lang="cn" />
    <source src="./t-cn/config.json" lang="t-cn" />
    <source src="./es/config.json" lang="es" />
</book-tool>
```

In the above code, we used the `source` tag to import documentation configuration files for different language versions. At the same time, the `lang` attribute is used to specify the language used in the document. The currently supported language options are as follows:

- English (en)
- Simplified Chinese (cn)
- Traditional Chinese (t-cn)
- Spanish (es)

By doing this, you can easily provide website content in the corresponding language version for users of different languages.
