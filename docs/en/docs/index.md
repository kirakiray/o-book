Unfortunately, as a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to physically "see" or "read" the document you mentioned. However, if you provide the text content or specific sentences from the document, I would be more than happy to translate them from Simplified Chinese to English for you.

o-book 2 is a document generation tool that will be one of the simplest document site generation tools you have ever used. With just one HTML file, you can generate a fully functional document website from your written Markdown articles. It is developed based on [ofa.js](https://ofajs.com/) and is very easy to use.

## Preparation before Use

Before using o-book, you need to grasp the basic syntax of [Markdown](https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown). Additionally, you will need a text editor. We recommend using Microsoft's [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as it is not only free but also offers a wide range of extensions to make your document editing work more efficient.

## Document Preparation

Before writing the document, it is necessary to prepare the basic project files locally. For your convenience, we have provided you with the initial files of the project. You only need to click on the following link to download and unzip them to your local computer:

[Download project files](../../publics/stand-up.zip)

Later on, we will explain the meanings of several key documents.

## Running the Project

The obook official provides three methods to run your project, and you can **choose one of the methods** to start according to your needs:

1. **Standard Mode**: Use a local server to view o-book components, thus previewing and generating the document site.
2. **Command Line Mode**: Use Node.js and command line to preview and generate the document site.
3. **Web Application Mode**: Select a local Markdown folder directly through the web page for previewing and generating.

[Standard Mode](./run-mode/base-mode.md) requires a static server to open the downloaded file.

Command line mode requires a certain foundation of front-end development knowledge. After installing the `o-book` module using `npm`, you can use the command line to preview and package projects. This mode can also be part of script automation.

[Web Application Mode](./run-mode/webapp-mode.md) does not require any development knowledge from you. You just need to open the website, select the local folder, and you will be able to view and package your project.
