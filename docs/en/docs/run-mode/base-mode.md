# Standard Mode

The standard mode is to use a local static server and open the prepared `_preview.html` file. If you are using our recommended VSCode editor, this step is very simple.

1. Open [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension page, click on Install, and the VSCode will automatically open and install the extension.

2. Unzip the downloaded project and open the folder using VSCode.

3. In VSCode, right-click on the `_preview.html` file in the root directory and select `open with live server`. Wait for the page to initialize, and then you can click on the links in the page for preview.

`_preview.html` file is the launcher for previewing the project. You can also choose not to use LiveServer and instead use other extensions that can start a static server.

This method of opening with VSCode has the lowest cost, and the editor can quickly start a static server. Of course, you can also use other Markdown editors such as Typora, development tools like Eclipse, or even your system's built-in text editor, as long as you find it convenient.

As for static servers, you can use locally hosted servers like Nginx, Apache, etc., as long as they can be used to access static HTML files.

## How to package

Similarly, in server mode, open `_preview.html` and click on "Download Website" to obtain the packaged static files.

Next, you can directly go to the [Base Files](../base-files.md) section to view more information.
