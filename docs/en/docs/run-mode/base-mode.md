# Standard Mode

Standard mode is to use the local static server and open the prepared `_preview.html` file. If you are using our recommended VSCode editor, then this step is very simple:

1. Open [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension page, click install, and it will automatically open VSCode and install the extension.

2. Unzip the downloaded project and open the folder with VSCode.

3. In VSCode, right-click on the `_preview.html` file in the root directory and select `open with live server`. After the page initialization is complete, you can click on the links on the page to preview.

`_preview.html` file is the launcher for previewing projects. You can also use other extensions that can start a static server instead of LiveServer.

This method of opening with VSCode has the lowest cost, and the editor can quickly start a static server. Of course, you can also use other Markdown editors, such as Typora, development tools such as Eclipse, or even the text editor that comes with your system, as long as you find it convenient.

As for static servers, you can use locally built servers, such as Nginx, Apache, etc., as long as they can be used to access static HTML files.

## How to package

Same as above, open `_preview.html` in server mode, click `Download Website` to get the packaged static files.

Next, you can directly access the [base file](../base-files.md) section for more information.
