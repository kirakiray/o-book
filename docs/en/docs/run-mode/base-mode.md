# Standard Mode

The standard mode is to use the local static server and open the prepared `_preview.html` file. If you use our recommended VSCode editor, this step is very simple.

1. Open the [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension page, click on "Install", and it will automatically open VSCode and install the extension.

2. Unzip the downloaded project and open the folder using VSCode.

3. In VSCode, right-click on the `_preview.html` file in the root directory and choose "Open with live server". Wait for the page to initialize and then you can click on the links on the page to preview.

The "_preview.html" file is the launcher for previewing the project. You can also use other extensions that can start a static server instead of LiveServer.

The cost of using VSCode to open is the lowest, and you can quickly launch a static server within the editor. Of course, you can also use other Markdown editors such as Typora, development tools like Eclipse, or even the text editor that comes with your system, as long as you find them convenient.

As for static servers, you can use locally installed servers like Nginx, Apache, etc. as long as they can be used to access static HTML files.

## How to package

Similarly, in server mode, open `_preview.html` and click on "Download Website" to obtain the packaged static files.

Next, you can directly go to the [base-files](../base-files.md) section to view more information.
