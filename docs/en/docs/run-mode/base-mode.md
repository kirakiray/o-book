# Standard Mode

The standard mode is to use a local static server and open the prepared `_preview.html` file. If you are using our recommended VSCode editor, this step is very simple:

1. Open the [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension page, click install, and then VSCode will automatically open and install the extension.

2. Unzip the downloaded project and open the folder with VSCode.

3. In VSCode, right-click on the `_preview.html` file in the root directory and select `open with live server`. After the page is initialized, you can click on the links on the page to preview.

`_preview.html` file is the launcher for previewing the project. You can also use other extensions that can start a static server instead of LiveServer.

This is the easy way to open using VSCode, where you can quickly launch a static server within the editor. Of course, you can also use other Markdown editors, such as Typora, development tools like Eclipse, or even your system's built-in text editor, as long as you find it convenient.

As for the static server, you can use locally built servers such as Nginx, Apache, etc., as long as they can be used to access static HTML files.

## How to package

Same as above, open `_preview.html` under server mode, click `Download Website` to get the packaged static files.

Next, you can directly go to the [base files](../base-files.md) section for more information.
