# Web Application Patterns

This document introduces various patterns for building web applications. Web application patterns are a set of best practices and reusable solutions to common problems encountered while developing web applications.

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
The MVC pattern separates an application into three components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and logic of the application, the view handles the presentation and rendering of the user interface, and the controller handles user input and communicates between the model and view.

2. Single-Page Application (SPA) Pattern
The SPA pattern allows for a seamless and interactive user experience by loading the entire web application on a single page. It leverages client-side rendering and asynchronous data fetching to update the UI without refreshing the page.

3. Progressive Web Application (PWA) Pattern
The PWA pattern combines the best of web and mobile applications to deliver an app-like experience to users. PWAs can be installed on a user's device and offer features such as offline mode, push notifications, and access to device hardware.

4. Microservices Architecture Pattern
The microservices architecture pattern breaks down a web application into smaller, loosely coupled services. Each service focuses on a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This pattern promotes modularity, flexibility, and easier maintenance.

5. RESTful API Pattern
The RESTful API pattern provides a standardized approach for designing web APIs. It follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) and allows clients to interact with the server through predefined endpoints and HTTP methods. This pattern fosters scalability, reusability, and interoperability.

6. Serverless Architecture Pattern
The serverless architecture pattern abstracts away server management and infrastructure tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing application logic. Serverless applications are event-driven and utilize cloud services, such as AWS Lambda, for executing code. This pattern reduces costs, improves scalability, and simplifies deployment.

This method is the most cost-effective way to use obook. The following are the steps to use it:

1. Use the latest version of the Chrome browser (or other browsers that support the File Access API) to open [obook webapp](https://kirakiray.github.io/o-book/webapp/).

2. Click the "Select Local Folder" button on the webpage to open your local project folder.

Now, you can click on the link for preview.

## How to package

Same steps as above, click the "Download Website" button on the page to download the pre-packaged document site.

This method is very simple and suitable for users who do not need complex settings and development knowledge.
